Chainlink Automation scaling &amp; loadbalancing 

## Motivation
_Nobody likes out-of-gas._

In [Cexles](https://cexles.finance) we need to scale [Chainlink Automation](https://chain.link/automation) to perform a huge number of on-chain operations in a single block and distribute their execution between multiple Chainlink Nodes without manual user intervention. 
This software will allow us to unlock the full potential of Chainlink Automation. 

## Current stage
We started an initial development of MVP with smart contracts deployed on Sepolia Ethereum testnet.

## Desired result
Hassle-free automated scaling for any Chainlink Automation compatible contract.
